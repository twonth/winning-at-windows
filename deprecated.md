* [CustomizerGod](https://www.door2windows.com/customizergod/): User-friendly way to replace certain Windows system icons. Was never updated for Windows 11 (or even later builds of Windows 10), so handle with care. **Decided it was simpler to stick to IconPackager combined with Resource Hacker.**


* [SmartTaskbar](https://github.com/ChanpleCai/SmartTaskbar): hide the taskbar only when it makes sense (when the focused window would overlap). **Annoying issue: Taskbar often covers the "Properties" function of the classic Explorer context menu.**

* [TaskbarControl](https://www.thefreewindows.com/3252/hide-completely-the-windows-taskbar-using-a-hotkey-and-unhide-it-with-taskbar-control/): assign a hotkey to toggle autohiding  the taskbar. Useful for touchscreen devices in combination with Stardock's TouchTasks. **Doesnt work as expected on Windows 11.**

* [xmplay](https://www.un4seen.com/):  ridiculously lightweight music player. Skinnable. But could use better high dpi support... See also [AIMP](https://www.aimp.ru/). **Decided [MPC-HC](https://github.com/clsid2/mpc-hc/releases/) was minimal enough for me.**

* [OldNewExplorer](https://m.majorgeeks.com/files/details/oldnewexplorer.html): Allows one to return to the good old days when cats were cats, dogs were dogs, and File Explorer was less ornate and cluttered. **I am back to the default Explorer appearance now that 22H2 has tabs.**


* [Ferdium](https://ferdium.org/): centralized portal for webapps. I use this to unite several different chat apps (Google Messages, Hangouts, Discord). The Facebook Messenger portal doesn't play nice with video calling, so I use [Caprine](https://sindresorhus.com/caprine/) for that. **Replaced in my workflow by [Beeper](https://www.beeper.com/).**

* [Mica For Everyone](https://github.com/MicaForEveryone/MicaForEveryone): Apply the Windows 11 Mica transparency effect to win32 apps. Does wonders for Explorer. **Replaced by [ExplorerBlurMica](https://github.com/Maplespe/ExplorerBlurMica).**

* [File Unlocker](https://github.com/marianpekar/file-unlocker-for-windows): Easily find and kill processes that are locking a file or folder. **Replaced by the File Locksmith tool within [PowerToys](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/releases/tag/v0.64.0).**


* [Process Hacker](https://github.com/processhacker/processhacker): Task Manager replacement. The [nightly versions](https://processhacker.sourceforge.io/nightly.php) have dark mode support. **Replaced by [Process Explorer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/process-explorer).**


* [SUMo](https://www.kcsoftwares.com/?sumo): Software Update MOnitor. Scans through your installed software to find applications which can be upgraded to a newer version. **Reached EOL October 2023**.

* [Fluent Search](https://www.fluentsearch.net/): Full featured search bar for Windows. The killer feature (for me) is the ability to find a file and drag and drop it from the search window into one of Windows' "open file" dialogue boxes. Huge timesaver. **I went back to Listary Pro.**


* [ThrottleStop](https://www.techpowerup.com/download/techpowerup-throttlestop/): fine-tune your CPU to balance power and performance. You can set up profiles to automatically switch power management options when toggling between being plugged in and running off battery. **Intel seems to put the kibosh on undervolting. Also... I've largely switched to AMD.**
